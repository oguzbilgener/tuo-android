# The Ultimate Organizer Android Application
This project has passed the build test on OS X 10.9.2 with Android Studio 0.5.8, Android SDK API level 19, Build Tools version 19.0.3 and JDK 1.7.0_25.
## Requirements
- Android Studio (latest possible version) with latest Android SDKs
- **tuo-core** (co.uberdev.ultimateorganizer.core) as a module dependency
- A computer with Internet connection to allow Gradle to download Maven dependencies.
- An Android 4.3+ virtual or real device to run on. The application should work on a few older versions but there were some bugs that we did not have time to fix. Our aim was to make this application work on Android 4.0+ in the first place.

## Build Instructions
After you have provided all the requirements, all you need is to hit the run button in Android Studio.

## Prebuilt APK
You can use the prebuilt application package `app.apk` to install it on your device.
